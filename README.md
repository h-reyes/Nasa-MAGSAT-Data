 # Nasa-MAGSAT-Data
NASA MAGSAT Data project, where the application is used to take and process data

This project serves the purpose of the retrieval and analysis of the NASA MAGSAT Data, which in this project solidifies the ability to read a file and output
the desired results.

"The Magsat project which is designed to provide precise measurements of the near-earth geomagnetic field is examined. Rapidly obtained global surveys are possible through satellite observations without the long-term variations obtained by conventional surface measurements. The altitude for Magsat measurements is a trade-off between the lowest possible altitude necessary for increasing the anomaly signals and their spatial resolution, and the minimum satellite lifetime necessary for obtaining adequate data distribution. A nominal perigee of 350 km was selected. The background leading to the project inception and mission objectives are discussed along with plans to study regional geology and geophysics."
